## Question-1
Given your experience with modernizing .NET applications and microservices, let's discuss a practical scenario:

"You're tasked with breaking down a monolithic .NET Framework application into microservices using .NET 8. The application processes customer orders and has tight coupling between order processing, inventory management, and payment processing. What would be your approach to this modernization, and what specific patterns would you implement to ensure the new microservices architecture is resilient and maintainable? Please include details about how you would handle data consistency across services."

Please provide your approach to this scenario.

### Answer
1. Analysis & Planning Phase:
   - Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach to identify bounded contexts
   - Event storming sessions with stakeholders to identify business processes
   - Dependency mapping between components

2. Architecture Design:
   - Implementation of the Strangler Fig Pattern for gradual migration
   - CQRS pattern to separate read and write operations
   - Event-Driven Architecture using message brokers (e.g., AWS SNS/SQS)
   - API Gateway pattern for client requests

3. Data Management:
   - Database-per-service pattern where appropriate
   - Saga pattern for distributed transactions
   - Event sourcing for maintaining data consistency
   - Implementation of eventual consistency where applicable

4. Resilience Patterns:
   - Circuit Breaker pattern using libraries like Polly
   - Retry patterns with exponential backoff
   - Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
   - Health checks and monitoring

5. Implementation Strategy:
   - Start with least dependent modules first
   - Implement API versioning
   - Use container orchestration (e.g., ECS)
   - Implement service discovery
   - Set up distributed tracing (e.g., AWS X-Ray)

6. Specific to the Order Processing System:
   - Order Service: Handles order creation and status
   - Inventory Service: Manages stock levels
   - Payment Service: Handles payment processing
   - Use choreography-based saga for order processing flow
